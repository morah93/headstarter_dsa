# In this task, you are required to generate a new array that is twice the length of an initial integer array 'nums' with a length of 'n'.
# The new array, dubbed 'ans', should be constructed such that the first half of 'ans' directly replicates the 'nums' array,
# and the second half is a repetition of the first, thereby doubling the sequence.
# Essentially, for each element with index 'i' in 'nums', 'ans[i] = nums[i]' and 'ans[i + n] = nums[i]', with 'i' ranging from 0 to 'n-1'.

# Your objective is to return the array 'ans' thus obtained.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,2,1]
# Output: [1,2,1,1,2,1]
# Explanation: The resulting 'ans' array combines 'nums' with itself, yielding [1,2,1,1,2,1].

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [1,3,2,1]
# Output: [1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1]
# Explanation: Similarly, the 'ans' array is formed by concatenating 'nums' with itself, resulting in [1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1].

# Constraints:
# - The length of 'nums' ('n') is guaranteed to be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
# - Each element in 'nums' can be any integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.

# Task Summary
# Step 1: Initialize the Answer List
# Step 2: Fill the First Half of the Answer List
# Step 3: Fill the Second Half of the Answer List
# Step 4: Return the Concatenated List


def generateDoubleSequence(nums):
    ans = [0] * (2 * len(nums))
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        ans[i] = nums[i]
        ans[i + len(nums)] = nums[i]
    return ans


# Step 1: Initialize the Answer List
# Start by initializing an empty list ans with a size of 2 * len(nums). This list will ultimately hold the concatenation of the nums array twice,
# once in the first half and once in the second half.

# Step 2: Fill the First Half of the Answer List
# Use a for loop to iterate through the original nums list. For each index i, set ans[i] to nums[i].

# This will fill up the first half of ans with elements from nums, mirroring the first requirement that ans[i] == nums[i] for 0 <= i < n.

# Step 3: Fill the Second Half of the Answer List
# In the same loop, also set ans[i + len(nums)] to nums[i].

# This step addresses the second requirement of the problem, ensuring the array ans also contains a copy of nums in its second half,
# fulfilling the condition ans[i + n] == nums[i] for 0 <= i < n.

# Step 4: Return the Concatenated List
# After the loop completes, the list ans will be fully populated with two copies of the array nums, one in each half.
# Return the ans list, which now represents the concatenation of two nums arrays as required by the problem statement.
