# We'll say that a "mirror" section in an array is a group of contiguous elements such that somewhere in the array, the same group appears in reverse order.
# For example, the largest mirror section in {1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 3, 2, 1} is length 3 (the {1, 2, 3} part). Return the size of the largest mirror section found in the given array.

# maxMirror([1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 3, 2, 1]) → 3
# maxMirror([1, 2, 1, 4]) → 3
# maxMirror([7, 1, 2, 9, 7, 2, 1]) → 2

def maxMirror(arr):
  pass


# Step 1: Initialize Maximum Length
# Initialize the maximum length of the mirror section to 0. This variable will keep track of the largest mirror section found in the array.

# Step 2: Outer Loop - Iterate Through Array
# Using a for loop, iterate through each element in the array arr with the index i. This loop will serve as the starting point for finding mirror sections.

# Step 3: Inner Loop - Iterate Backwards to Find Mirror
# Within the outer loop, initialize another for loop to iterate backwards through the array arr with the index j starting from the end of the array to the beginning.
# This loop helps in finding potential mirror sections by moving backward.

# Step 4: Initialize Current Length
# For each pair of starting positions i and j from the outer and inner loops, initialize the variable length to 0.
# This variable represents the length of the current mirror section being examined.

# Step 5: While Loop - Explore Potential Mirror Section
# Start a while loop to explore the potential mirror section. Continue the loop as long as the following conditions are met:

# The forward index (i + length) is within array bounds.
# The backward index (j - length - 1) is within array bounds.
# The elements at the forward and backward indices (arr[i + length] == arr[j - length - 1]) are equal.


# If these conditions are met, increment the length by 1.

# Step 6: Update Maximum Length
# After exiting the while loop, update max_length with the maximum value between the current max_length and the current length of the mirror section just found.
# This step ensures that max_length always holds the maximum size of a mirror section found so far.

# Step 7: Return Maximum Mirror Section Length
# Once both outer and inner loops are complete, return the value of max_length. This value represents the size of the largest mirror section found in the array.
